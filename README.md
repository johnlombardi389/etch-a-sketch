# Pixel Sketch App

Create your own pixel art by selecting your canvas size and color, then click to draw on the grid. Inspired by the classic etch-a-sketch.

## Overview

Create your own pixel art using the Pixel Sketch App. My role in this project was to flex as much of my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills as currently possible. You can select your canvas size, choose your color, and freely click and drag your mouse on the grid to create your own pixel art. JavaScript will generate your grid canvas and allow you to change the color of each element based on your actions to create your own pixel art.

## What I Learned

- Better understanding of manipulating elements in the DOM with JavaScript
- Adding and removing classes, as well as changing style properties of individual elements
- Click and mousedown event listeners / arrow functions
